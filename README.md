# NFT Generator Project

This project aims to create a collection of unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by combining different elements such as ears, eyes, head, and mouth to generate random pictures. These NFTs can then be traded or sold on platforms like OpenSea.

## Overview

The project utilizes a combination of Python, Solidity, and JavaScript to achieve its goals:

- **Python**: Used for generating random combinations of elements (ears, eyes, head, mouth) to create unique NFTs.
- **Solidity**: Smart contracts are written in Solidity to manage the creation and ownership of the NFTs.
- **JavaScript**: Interacts with the smart contracts and handles functionalities related to publishing the collection on the OpenSea marketplace.

## How It Works

1. **Image Generation**: In a simple drawing program (like Paint), elements such as ears, eyes, head, and mouth are drawn separately.
2. **Combination**: The Python script combines these elements randomly to generate unique images, each representing an NFT.
3. **Smart Contract**: Solidity smart contracts manage the creation, ownership, and transfer of these NFTs, ensuring their uniqueness and authenticity.
4. **OpenSea Integration**: JavaScript code facilitates the publishing of the NFT collection on the OpenSea marketplace, making it available for trading and selling.
